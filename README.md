## Evaluating the Impact of Traditional Anonymization Filters on State-of-the-Art Facial Recognition Performance

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the final project of the MSc course Biometric Systems - 02238 at DTU. The project investigates how traditional anonymization techniques (Gaussian blur, Median blur, Pixelization, and Black Bands) affect the performance of MagFace, a state-of-the-art facial recognition model. The study leverages a subset of the **CelebA dataset** to assess the impact of various filters on recognition accuracy, contributing to a better understanding of privacy-preserving techniques in digital and surveillance environments.
